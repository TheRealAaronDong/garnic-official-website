	<p>Our organisation, the Global Agency Regarding Neutralisation of Insane Criminals (GARNIC) was founded on the 32nd of January, 473 232 636 463 635 986 138 528 BCE. It was founded by successful businessman and ex-intelligence agent, Sir ARD. At the time, he was in the galactic spotlight following his most famous feat, becoming the most affluent man in existence. At GARNIC, we are upholding his legacy of protecting Earth from mentally unstable criminal overlords. In his time, he had thwarted over 434 341 654 353 791 insane criminals, the most anyone had detained. We cannot disclose details of his personal life because quite frankly, we know nothing about him. We don't even know whether he is alive today or not. He has now been disconnected from the GARNIC community and has never appeared since his famous 1 AD appearance in which everyone who laid eyes on him mysteriously disappeared. The only reason we know he came is the fact he scratched his name on Uluru, which disappeared immediately after he left. He gained his knighthood from King Arthur who dubbed him "a legendary figure in all of history and existence" after meeting him for 1.5262 milliseconds.</p>
